# Cart Pole Left Right

Modified version of the [cart-pole](https://www.gymlibrary.ml/environments/classic_control/cart_pole/) environment where the agent has to balance the pole on the left or right side of the screen based on a state returned by the environment.

The code is a notebook file which is ready to use on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

[RLlib] is used for training the agent using PPO and DQN algorithms.

### TODO
* Add more algorithms
* Experiment with more advanced exploration methods
